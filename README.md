# scientific-computing
This repository contains various Python scripts demonstrating basic programming concepts, including data types, control structures, and functions.

## Objectives
1.datatypes.py
  - Creates one variable of each fundamental data type in Python:
    - `int`, `float`, `complex`, `list`, `tuple`, `dict`, `set`, and `bool`.
  - Uses Python’s built-in `type()` function to print the data type of each variable.
  - Converts an integer to a float and float to interger, displaying the results.

2.control_structures.py 
  - Asks the user for an integer and checks if it's even or odd.  
  - Uses a `for` loop to generate a list of even numbers from 1 to 50.  
  - Uses a `while` loop to print numbers from 10 down to 1 in reverse order.  
  - Implements a function to classify numbers as even or odd.  

3.modular_functions.py
  - Defines a function `calculate_area(shape, dimension1, dimension2=0)` to compute the area of different shapes:  
    - circle: Uses the formula πr².  
    -rectangle: Uses the formula length × width.  
    - triangle: Uses the formula (1/2) × base × height.  
 ## how to run the script 
 by ensuring that one has installed python one can run the scripts by:
 1.datatype.py
 One can run the command python datatype.py and the expected outcomes are : 
 -Prints the data type of each variable.
 -Converts an integer to a float and vice versa, displaying the results.
2.control_structures.py:
One must run the command python control_structures.py and the expected outcomes are : 
-Prompts the user to enter an integer.
-Tells if the number is even or odd.
-Prints even numbers from 1 to 50.
-Counts down from 10 to 1 using a while loop.
3. modular_functions.py:
One must run the command python modular_functions.py and the expected outcomes are:
-Calculates and prints the area of a circle, rectangle, and triangle using a function

## what i have learnt

-Converting between int, float, and other types using built-in functions.
-Using if-else statements, for loops, and while loops for flow control.
-Writing modular and reusable functions
